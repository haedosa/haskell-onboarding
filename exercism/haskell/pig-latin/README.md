# Pig Latin

Welcome to Pig Latin on Exercism's Haskell Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Introduction

Your parents have challenged you and your sibling to a game of two-on-two basketball.
Confident they'll win, they let you score the first couple of points, but then start taking over the game.
Needing a little boost, you start speaking in [Pig Latin][pig-latin], which is a made-up children's language that's difficult for non-children to understand.
This will give you the edge to prevail over your parents!

## Instructions

Your task is to translate text from English to Pig Latin.
The translation is defined using four rules, which look at the pattern of vowels and consonants at the beginning of a word.
These rules look at each word's use of vowels and consonants:

- vowels: the letters `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u`
- consonants: the other 21 letters of the English alphabet

## Rule 1

If a word begins with a vowel, or starts with `"xr"` or `"yt"`, add an `"ay"` sound to the end of the word.

For example:

- `"apple"` -> `"appleay"` (starts with vowel)
- `"xray"` -> `"xrayay"` (starts with `"xr"`)
- `"yttria"` -> `"yttriaay"` (starts with `"yt"`)

## Rule 2

If a word begins with a one or more consonants, first move those consonants to the end of the word and then add an `"ay"` sound to the end of the word.

For example:

- `"pig"` -> `"igp"` -> `"igpay"` (starts with single consonant)
- `"chair"` -> `"airch"` -> `"airchay"` (starts with multiple consonants)
- `"thrush"` -> `"ushthr"` -> `"ushthray"` (starts with multiple consonants)

## Rule 3

If a word starts with zero or more consonants followed by `"qu"`, first move those consonants (if any) and the `"qu"` part to the end of the word, and then add an `"ay"` sound to the end of the word.

For example:

- `"quick"` -> `"ickqu"` -> `"ay"` (starts with `"qu"`, no preceding consonants)
- `"square"` -> `"aresqu"` -> `"aresquay"` (starts with one consonant followed by `"qu`")

## Rule 4

If a word starts with one or more consonants followed by `"y"`, first move the consonants preceding the `"y"`to the end of the word, and then add an `"ay"` sound to the end of the word.

Some examples:

- `"my"` -> `"ym"` -> `"ymay"` (starts with single consonant followed by `"y"`)
- `"rhythm"` -> `"ythmrh"` -> `"ythmrhay"` (starts with multiple consonants followed by `"y"`)

The unit tests provide examples of words. Try and cluster consonants
independent of the specific combinations of consonants in the unit tests.

This exercise works with textual data. For historical reasons, Haskell's
`String` type is synonymous with `[Char]`, a list of characters. For more
efficient handling of textual data, the `Text` type can be used.

As an optional extension to this exercise, you can

- Read about [string types](https://haskell-lang.org/tutorial/string-types) in Haskell.
- Add `- text` to your list of dependencies in package.yaml.
- Import `Data.Text` in [the following way](https://hackernoon.com/4-steps-to-a-better-imports-list-in-haskell-43a3d868273c):

      import qualified Data.Text as T
      import           Data.Text (Text)

- You can now write e.g. `translate :: Text -> Text` and refer to `Data.Text` combinators as e.g. `T.isSuffixOf`.
- Look up the documentation for [`Data.Text`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text/docs/Data-Text.html),

This part is entirely optional.
