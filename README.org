** Resources
- Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!: A Beginner's Guide
- Algorithm Design with Haskell
- Functional Programming Course (github:system-f/fp-course)
- Exercism

** Available Platform
- [[https://replit.com/~][Replit]]
  - If there is no startup =Console=, press the green =Run= button to start =ghci=.
  - Inside =ghci=, run =:l Main= to load =Main.hs=
  - Alternatively, run =:l learn-you-a-haskell/src/First= to load =learn-you-a-haskell/src/First.hs=
  - If you quit the first =ghci=, then =devShells.x86_64-linux.replit= is run by =direnv=
  - Although =.envrc= file is not in =git=, it is needed for =direnv=


** Exercism Guide

*** Pull Exercism exercises
- Start [[https://exercism.org/tracks/haskell][Haskell track in Exercism]] and run the below command
#+begin_src bash :eval never-export
->> nix shell nixpkgs#exercism && ./exercism/get-exercises.sh haskell
#+end_src

*** How to run test before submission
#+begin_src bash :eval never-export
->> nix run .#[Press tab twice]
